/// This type never owns the native window or the Session. The
/// caller keeps both alive through asynchronous retirement. One controller
/// stays at a stable address for the Session's full Surface history, so it is
/// neither copyable nor movable and replacement views cannot reset generation
/// identity. Destroying a live controller is a programming error and
/// terminates, matching `std::thread`'s
/// fail-fast treatment of a still-joinable thread: silently leaking the only
/// attachment/release handle would make safe native-window teardown impossible.
/// The same applies to `Faulted`: a successful ABI transition that returned no
/// required handle, or a failed transition that nevertheless returned an
/// ownership handle, has made safe target teardown unknowable.
/// `first_generation` must be non-zero and greater than the Session's last
/// accepted generation when adopting a Session previously driven without this
/// controller; new Sessions use the default value 1. Construct and call the
/// controller on the Session's owner thread; foreign-thread calls fail before
/// entering the C ABI.
